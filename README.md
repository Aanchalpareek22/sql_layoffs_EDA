# SQL Layoffs Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed using **SQL** on a global layoffs dataset.

I worked on this project while learning SQL by following a YouTube tutorial series.  
The main goal was to practice **real-world SQL queries**, understand how data cleaning works, and explore trends in layoffs across different companies, industries, and years.

## What This Project Covers

- Creating staging tables for safe data cleaning  
- Handling NULL values and inconsistent data  
- Exploring layoffs based on:
  - Companies
  - Industries
  - Countries
  - Total layoffs and percentage layoffs
- Finding maximum, minimum, and trend-based insights using SQL queries

## Tools & Technologies

- MySQL  
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Filtering, EDA queries)

## Files in This Repository

- `EDA.sql` – Contains all SQL queries used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis


##  Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a publicly available layoffs dataset (commonly used for SQL practice and EDA projects).


## What I Learned

- How to approach data cleaning step-by-step
- Writing cleaner and more readable SQL queries
- How EDA helps in understanding patterns before deeper analysis
- Gained confidence working with real datasets instead of just sample tables
